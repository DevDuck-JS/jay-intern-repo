### üîç Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

The multiple cursors shortcut (Cmd + Click on Mac) will be especially useful, as it allows me to edit multiple lines at once, perfect for refactoring code or updating repeated values. I also find Cmd + P (Quick file navigation) and Cmd + Shift + F (Global search) very helpful when working across large codebases.

### üìù How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts reduce the time spent switching between mouse and keyboard, helping me stay focused in the flow of coding. They allow for faster navigation, quicker editing, and more efficient debugging, ultimately helping me get more done in less time with fewer interruptions.
