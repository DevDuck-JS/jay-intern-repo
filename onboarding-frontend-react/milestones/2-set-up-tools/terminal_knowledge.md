# 📌 Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

## 🎯 Goal

A good terminal setup makes development smoother. Choose a terminal client and get comfortable using it.

### ✅ Tasks

#### 1️⃣ Set up a terminal client of your choice (e.g., iTerm2 + zsh on Mac, Windows Terminal + PowerShell, or any other)

#### 2️⃣ Customize it if desired (e.g., themes, aliases, plugins)

#### 3️⃣ Research basic terminal usage and write your reflections in terminal_knowledge.md

##### Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I have MacBook's native Terminal and Warp.

##### What customizations (if any) did you make?

I played around with Terminal's background color and opacity. I did not make any customization on Warp.

##### What was the most useful command you learned today?

I already have some experience using commands in Terminal. Here are the commands I use very often and useful to get familair to:

###### 🗂️ File & Folder Navigation

1. `ls` – Lists files and folders in the current directory.
   Example: ls -la shows hidden files and permissions.

2. `cd [folder]` – Changes directory.
   Example: cd src/components

3. `pwd` – Prints the current directory path.
   Example: Useful to check where you are in the project.

###### 📁 File & Folder Management

1. `mkdir [foldername]` – Creates a new folder.
   Example: mkdir assets

2. `touch [filename]` – Creates a new file.
   Example: touch index.js

3. `rm [filename]` – Removes a file.
   Example: rm oldFile.txt

4. `rm -r [foldername]` – Removes a folder and its contents.

###### 🧰 Development Utilities

1. `code .` – Opens the current directory in VS Code (requires VS Code command line tools installed).

2. `git status` – Shows current Git status (uncommitted changes, branch, etc.).

3. `git clone [repo-url]` – Clones a remote Git repository.

4. `npm install` – Installs project dependencies listed in package.json.

5. `npm run [script]` – Runs a defined npm script.
   Example: npm run dev to start a dev server.

#### 4️⃣ Commit and push your changes to GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once completed, move on to the next issue (Git commands & workflows). ✅
