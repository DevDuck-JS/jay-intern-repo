# 📌 Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

## 🎯 Goal

A good terminal setup makes development smoother. Choose a terminal client and get comfortable using it.

### ✅ Tasks

#### 1️⃣ Install Git command line tools and verify installation (git --version)

I already git installed:

````jay-intern-repo $ git --version
git version 2.39.3 (Apple Git-145)
jay-intern-repo $```

#### 2️⃣ Decide if you want to use a Git client (e.g., GitHub Desktop, Git in VS Code) and set it up if needed

I have some experience using GitHub Desktop, Git client in terminal, and Git in Vs Code. However, I prefer using Git in VS Code as I can see visaulized updates in related files.

#### 3️⃣ Research basic terminal usage and write your reflections in terminal_knowledge.md

##### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used Git before for source management context, full-stack development projects and CICD projects.

##### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
 I usually use Git in VS Code because the changes are relected in VS Code interface and make me spot them quickly.

##### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

N/A

#### 4️⃣ Commit and push your changes to GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once completed, move on to the next Git-related issue (Git commands & workflows).
