# üìå Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

#### üéØ Goal

Enhance your development workflow by installing browser extensions that help with debugging and productivity.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Chrome (or your preferred browser) if not already installed ‚úÖ

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the following extensions

1. React Developer Tools (inspect React components)

2. Redux DevTools (debug Redux state)

3. JSON Viewer (pretty-print API responses)

4. Lighthouse (performance auditing for web apps)

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Research & document your setup in chrome_extensions.md

##### Which extensions did you install? Why?

I installed every extensions listed to extend my experience with tools and optimize my productiviy.

React Developer Tools ‚Äì To inspect the component tree of React apps, view props and state, and debug more effectively during development.

Redux DevTools ‚Äì To monitor Redux store updates, track dispatched actions, and time-travel through state changes for better debugging.

JSON Viewer Pro ‚Äì To format and highlight JSON responses from APIs, making it easier to read and understand data while testing endpoints.

Lighthouse ‚Äì To audit web apps for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices, which helps ensure high-quality front-end code.

##### What was the most useful thing you learned?

The most useful thing I learned was how Redux DevTools lets you trace the exact flow of state changes, which makes debugging much easier when working with complex data or user interactions. It gave me more visibility into how different actions affect the app state over time.
