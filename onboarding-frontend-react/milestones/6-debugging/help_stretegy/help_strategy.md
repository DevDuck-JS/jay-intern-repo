# üèÜ Milestone: 6. Debugging

## When you get stuck - When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help? #32

### üéØ Goal

Develop a strategy to determine when to use search engines, AI tools, or seek help from colleagues during problem-solving.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Research best practices for troubleshooting coding problems.

###### Spend 30 minutes talking with Chat GPT to understand different perspectives on using AI in coding. When is it helpful and when is it not?

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Develop a decision-making framework:

##### Create a flowchart or decision tree in Miro outlining scenarios where each resource (Google, AI tools, colleagues) would be most appropriate.

##### Consider factors such as:

###### The complexity of the problem.

###### The sensitivity of the information.

###### The urgency of the task.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Export the flowchart and add it to your GitHub repo.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Write a reflection in help_strategy.md:

##### When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

I prefer using AI tools like ChatGPT when I need quick explanations, starter code snippets, or help understanding a concept in plain language. AI is great at summarizing documentation or suggesting debugging steps based on vague symptoms.

I turn to Google when I want to verify official documentation, read forum discussions (e.g., Stack Overflow), or explore multiple perspectives on a specific error message or library.

Example:
If I encounter a useEffect dependency issue in React, I might first ask AI why it occurs. Then I‚Äôll Google to read GitHub issues or MDN documentation to confirm best practices.

##### How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when:

- The issue is project-specific and involves internal logic, shared files, or environment setup.

- I‚Äôve already spent 30+ minutes trying to solve it independently using AI and Google.

- The problem might affect others on the team, and clarifying it early could save time.

Example:
If an API response looks correct but the app isn't rendering as expected, I might ask the teammate who worked on that component to avoid guessing.

##### What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- Tunnel vision ‚Äì It‚Äôs easy to keep trying the same solution instead of stepping back.

- Time loss ‚Äì Spending too long on one bug without asking for help can block progress.

- Lack of context ‚Äì Sometimes, only teammates know project-specific quirks or recent changes.

As a result, balancing self-research, AI usage, and team collaboration is crucial for productive debugging.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
