# üèÜ Milestone: 7. Redux

## üìå Introduction to Redux Toolkit (State Management) #25

### üéØ Goal

Manage global state effectively using Redux Toolkit.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Redux Toolkit and React Redux.

Run this in the root directory:

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Redux store and configure a slice for a counter.

Create a file: src/redux/store.js

```
// src/redux/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

Create a file: src/redux/counterSlice.js

```
// src/redux/counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Create a file or update src/components/Counter.js

```
// src/components/Counter.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from '../redux/counterSlice';

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Count: {count}</h1>
      <div className="space-x-4">
        <button
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
          className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
        >
          -
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
          className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
        >
          +
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use useSelector and useDispatch to connect Redux to the Counter.js component.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push your Redux setup to GitHub.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection (in redux_fundamentals.md):

##### When should you use Redux instead of useState?

I should use Redux instead of useState when:

- I need to share state across multiple components that aren‚Äôt directly connected in the component tree.

- The application state is complex, such as nested or deeply structured data.

- I require a predictable and centralized store to help with debugging, logging, and time travel (via Redux DevTools).

- The app involves side effects like async API calls and needs middleware like redux-thunk or redux-saga.

Example: In a productivity app like Focus Bear, global user settings (e.g. theme, preferences, authentication) are better managed with Redux since they are accessed by various components across the app.

## üìå Using Selectors in Redux Toolkit #24

### üéØ Goal

Learn how to extract state efficiently from Redux.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a selector function to get the current counter value from Redux.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use useSelector to access the counter value in multiple components.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the app to display different messages based on the counter value.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push your Redux setup to GitHub.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection (in redux_fundamentals.md):

##### What are the benefits of using selectors instead of directly accessing state?

Encapsulation: Selectors hide the shape of the state, so components don‚Äôt depend on the exact structure of the Redux store.

- Reusability: Once created, selectors can be reused across multiple components, reducing duplicated logic.

- Performance Optimization: Memoized selectors (e.g., using `reselect`) prevent unnecessary re-renders by caching results when state hasn‚Äôt changed.

- Improved Readability: Selectors give meaningful names to data access logic, making code easier to understand.

Example: Instead of accessing `state.counter.value` directly in every component, a `selectCounterValue(state)` function makes the code cleaner and more maintainable.
