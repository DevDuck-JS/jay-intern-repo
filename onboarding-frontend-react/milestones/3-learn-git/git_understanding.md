# 🏆 Milestone: Learn Git

## 📌 Creating & Reviewing Pull Requests

### 🎯 Goal

Learn how to create, review, and collaborate on Pull Requests (PRs) in GitHub.

### 🛠️ Task

#### 1️⃣ Research what a Pull Request (PR) is and why it’s used

A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a codebase on platforms like GitHub. It allows developers to submit their changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) to be reviewed and merged into another branch (usually the main branch).

PRs are used to collaborate, review code, catch bugs, and discuss improvements before the changes are added to the main project. They help maintain code quality and encourage teamwork.

#### 2️⃣ Create a new branch in your Git desktop client

#### 3️⃣ Make a small change and push the branch to GitHub

#### 4️⃣ Open a Pull Request on GitHub

- Add a meaningful PR title and description.
- Link to a related issue (if applicable).

#### 5️⃣ Review an existing PR in a public open-source repo (e.g., React PRs):

- Read through comments and discussions.
- Observe how changes are requested and approved.

#### 6️⃣ Write reflections in git_understanding.md:

- Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
- What makes a well-structured PR?
- What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?

#### 5️⃣ Request feedback on your PR from a peer or mentor.

#### 7️⃣ Merge the PR (if approved) and delete the branch.
