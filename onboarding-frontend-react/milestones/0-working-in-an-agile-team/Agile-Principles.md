# üèÜ Milestone: Agile at Focus Bear

## üöÄ Working in an Agile Team

### üéØ Goal

Understand how Focus Bear‚Äôs agile team operates, including roles, workflows, and collaboration practices.

### üìå Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management that prioritizes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability. While Waterfall, the traditional project management follows a linear, step-by-step approach with fixed requirements and long planning cycles.

In Agile, teams release small updates frequently, while in Waterfall, the product is delivered in a single final release after months of development.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

Instead of rigidly following a year-long roadmap, an Agile team adapts priorities based on user feedback.

**Core Values:**

- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

**Key Principles:**

- Deliver value frequently in small, working increments
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Encourage continuous collaboration between teams and customers
- Maintain a sustainable work pace for long-term productivity

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

Scrum is an Agile framework where work is divided into fixed-length sprints, typically lasting 1‚Äì2 weeks. The team commits to completing a specific set of tasks during each sprint, promoting focus and predictability. Scrum relies on structured ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to maintain alignment, improve collaboration, and reflect on performance.

Kanban is a flexible Agile workflow that focuses on a continuous flow of work rather than time-boxed sprints. It emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) to reduce bottlenecks and improve efficiency. Unlike Scrum, Kanban has no fixed roles‚Äîany team member can pick up tasks based on capacity, making it highly adaptable and responsive to change.

In a common use case, a software development team might use Scrum for structured product releases, while a customer support team uses Kanban to handle incoming tickets continuously.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

Kanban is more flexible‚Äîworkflows can adapt quickly without being locked into a sprint. Continuous prioritization‚Äîtasks move fluidly instead of being planned in batches. Better suited for a small, dynamic team‚Äîno need for rigid sprint commitments

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

Common benefits of Agile are more adaptability to change, faster delivery of working software, collaboration and transparency. While the challenges that come with this project management method is that it requires strong communication to avoid misalignment and less structure working style compared to Waterfall method, the traditional project management.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Since Agile offers more flexibility, I can adapt to changing requirements more easily. I can also priotized smaller, high-impact features rather than waiting for a big release since Agile focuses more on devliering value than the structured process. The repeating ceremonies allow me to receive continuous feedback to improve my performance.

Instead of spending weeks on a perfect, large feature, I can release a small version, gather feedback, and iterate.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words

Scrum is structured with sprints and defined roles, while Kanban is continuous and flexible. It commits to a fixed scope per sprint, while Kanban limits work in progress (WIP) but adapts priorities dynamically.
Scrum is like a relay race (work is planned in segments), while Kanban is like a flowing highway (tasks move as needed).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work

‚ÄúDeliver working software frequently‚Äù will help me focus on small, iterative improvements rather than delaying progress for a big release. Instead of building a full new feature all at once, I can release a basic version first, then expand based on feedback.
