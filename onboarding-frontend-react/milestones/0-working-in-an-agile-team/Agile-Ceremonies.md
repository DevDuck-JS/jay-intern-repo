# üèÜ Milestone: Working in an agile team

## Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?

##### Daily Stand-ups

A short 15-minute meeting where the team shares updates on their progress, roadblocks, and priorities for the day.
Each member answers three key questions: What did I work on yesterday? What will I work on today? Any blockers?

##### Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)

Sprint Planning (Scrum): A meeting to define what work will be completed in a sprint (usually 1-2 weeks).
Continuous Prioritization (Kanban): Instead of sprints, work is continuously pulled from a prioritized backlog as capacity allows.

In a Scrum team, a Sprint Planning meeting helps decide what tasks to complete in the next two weeks.

##### Retrospectives

A meeting held at the end of a sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn‚Äôt, and how to improve.
After a sprint, the team discusses what processes can be improved to make work smoother.

##### Backlog Refinement

A session to review, prioritize, and break down tasks in the product backlog to ensure they are well-defined for future sprints.
The team meets to clarify upcoming tasks and adjust priorities based on new insights.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

- Use async communication tools ‚Äì Slack, Notion, or Jira to track updates and discussions.
- Record meetings & document decisions ‚Äì Ensure teammates in different time zones can catch up.
- Clearly define responsibilities & deadlines ‚Äì Avoid blockers when teammates work at different hours.
- Use flexible stand-ups ‚Äì Allow async updates for those who can‚Äôt attend live.

A team with members in Australia and the US records sprint meetings and shares key points in Notion so everyone stays aligned.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Each agile ceremonies can benefit team's alignments in different perspective.

- Daily Stand-ups keep everyone updated on progress and blockers.
- Sprint Planning & Backlog Refinement ensure work is clearly prioritized.
- Retrospectives improve processes and teamwork over time.

A well-run stand-up prevents confusion by ensuring everyone knows who is working on what and can offer help if needed.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

Backlog Refinement is the most important because it ensures tasks are well-defined, prioritized, and ready to be worked on.

If a backlog item lacks clarity, developers may waste time figuring out what to do instead of coding.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared

- Noted how each team member provided brief, structured updates.
- Saw how blockers were raised early to avoid delays.

A teammate mentioned an API issue, and another offered a fix immediately.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one

- Learned about team challenges and successes from the last sprint.
- Identified areas where the team could improve communication and workflow.

The team decided to document deployment steps better after facing deployment issues.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration

- Change: I will ensure all my updates in stand-ups are concise, relevant, and include blockers if needed.
- Why? This helps teammates quickly understand progress and offer support where necessary.

Instead of just saying "I worked on UI updates," I will say:
"I completed the new dashboard UI and need feedback before merging. No blockers."
