# üèÜ Milestone: Working in an agile team

## Agile Workflows & Kanban

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board visually represents work progress by organizing tasks into different stages. It helps teams:

1. Track workflow in real time
2. Identify bottlenecks early
3. Maintain steady progress without overload

A development team uses a Kanban board to move tasks from Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done, ensuring visibility on work status.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)

- Backlog: Tasks that are planned but not yet started.
- In Progress: Tasks actively being worked on.
- Blocked: Tasks that are stuck due to dependencies or issues.
- Review: Tasks waiting for approval or testing.
- Done: Completed tasks.

A developer working on a new feature moves a task from Backlog ‚Üí In Progress when they start coding.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move left to right as work progresses. The person working on a task updates its status when moving it to the next stage. If a task is blocked, it should be marked as such to get support.

A QA tester moves a feature from Review ‚Üí Done after confirming it passes testing.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

WIP reduces context switching, helping team members stay focused. It also prevents bottlenecks by ensuring tasks are completed before starting new ones. Furthermore, it improves efficiency by encouraging teams to finish work before taking on more.

A team sets a WIP limit of 3 tasks per person so developers don‚Äôt get overwhelmed.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban visualizes workload, making it easy to see what‚Äôs pending and in progress while WIP limits prevent overcommitment, ensuring realistic workloads. With Kanban and WIP, prioritization becomes easier as urgent tasks move forward first.

If too many tasks pile up in In Progress, the team can pause new work and focus on clearing existing tasks.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by ...

- Regularly updating task statuses to maintain clear visibility.
- Setting personal WIP limits to avoid juggling too many tasks at once.
- Breaking down large tasks into smaller steps for better tracking.

Instead of working on five tasks at once, I‚Äôll limit myself to two active tasks at a time.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

- Observed how tasks are categorized into Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Review, and Done.
- Noted how priority tasks are placed at the top of each column.

A "Bug Fix" task was in Review, waiting for final approval before moving to Done.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly

- Picked a task from Backlog, started working on it, and moved it to In Progress.
- Updated the task notes to indicate the current progress.

Moved a UI improvement task from Backlog ‚Üí In Progress, then updated notes for visibility.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role

**Solution:** Add more detailed descriptions and updates in task comments for better visibility.

**Example:** Instead of just marking a task "In Progress", I will add a comment like "Currently fixing responsiveness issues on the dashboard‚ÄîETA 2 days."
