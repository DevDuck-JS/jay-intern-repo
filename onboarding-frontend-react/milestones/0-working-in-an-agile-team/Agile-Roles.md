# üèÜ Milestone: Roles in an Agile Team

## Roles in an Agile Team

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

##### Developers

- Write, test, and deploy code to build product features.
- Collaborate with QA to ensure quality and resolve issues.

##### QA (Quality Assurance)

- Test features to identify bugs and ensure product reliability.
- Provide feedback to developers to improve software quality.

##### Product Manager (PM)

- Defines product vision and prioritizes features based on business goals.
- Works with stakeholders to align development with user needs.

##### Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)

- Facilitates Agile ceremonies and removes roadblocks for the team.
- Ensures smooth workflow and team alignment.

##### Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)

- UX Designers create user-friendly experiences and interfaces.
- Customer Support gathers user feedback and reports product issues.
- Stakeholders provide business requirements and feedback on the product.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

**Kanban:** Continuous workflow, tasks are pulled as needed, no fixed sprints.

- Developers, QA, and PMs work on ongoing prioritization instead of sprint cycles.
- Agile PM ensures smooth task flow and removes blockers.

**Scrum:** Work is divided into sprints with fixed timelines.

- Developers and QA commit to specific tasks per sprint during planning.
- Agile PM facilitates daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives.
- PM prioritizes the backlog before each sprint to align with business goals.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role involves developing and maintaining front-end software features while ensuring code quality and performance.
I contribute by collaborating with QA to test functionality and with PMs to clarify requirements.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

Here are some responsibilities overlap and interact with other roles as a front-end developer:
I communicate with PMs to understand feature requirements and suggest technical improvements.
I collaborate with UX designers to ensure smooth and accessible user experiences.
I work closely with QA to debug issues and fix reported bugs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

As a front-end developer, I write, review, and deploy code to build product features. I work with QA to test functionality and with PMs to refine requirements. I participate in stand-ups, backlog refinement, and retrospectives to improve workflows.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

I frequently collaborate with QA to ensure product quality. To improve teamwork, I can provide better documentation for test cases and fix reported issues faster by prioritizing critical bugs.
