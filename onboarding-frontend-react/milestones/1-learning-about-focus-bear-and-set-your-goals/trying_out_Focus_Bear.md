# üìå First-Time User Experience Assignment

## ‚úÖ Task: Download & Test the Focus Bear App

üìå Approach this as if you're a brand-new user who just discovered the app. Your goal is to experience the onboarding process and identify areas for improvement.

### ‚úÖ Steps

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download & install the Focus Bear app using [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_kOTNYaebJpggfaspQLgevDaYbcn1oDeoXRYOh404g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7d2jg49m2emo) ‚úÖ

According to my devices, I followed instructions For Mac Users and For iOS Users (Beta).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore the app as if you were a new user ‚úÖ

I have saved my user journey here [Figma Board: milestone-1/trying_out_Focus_Bear.md/explore-the-app](https://www.figma.com/design/osmtseydPHIBYnxiYAZ67g/milestone-1%2Ftrying_out_Focus_Bear.md%2Fexplore-the-app?node-id=0-1&t=Cv6LEXE2dsJenFZM-1).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Take notes on anything that feels confusing, frustrating, or unclear ‚úÖ

As per the **Self-install Instructions**, I think the goole doc should be view-only for anyone and editable for specific staff only.

As per the **applications on my MacBook**, I have put the screenshot of my journey using MacOS Focus Bear application [Figma Board: milestone-1/trying_out_Focus_Bear.md/explore-the-app](https://www.figma.com/design/osmtseydPHIBYnxiYAZ67g/milestone-1%2Ftrying_out_Focus_Bear.md%2Fexplore-the-app?node-id=0-1&t=Cv6LEXE2dsJenFZM-1)

As per the **applications on my iPhone**,

I'm currently facing a blocker on how to install the app

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Think about how the onboarding experience could be improved

1. Add a simple onboarding walkthrough or tutorial when the app is first opened: As an freshly new user, when I was adding a new Goal, I wasn‚Äôt sure about the difference between ‚ÄòApply Changes‚Äô and ‚ÄòSave Goals‚Äô. Go to [Figma Board: milestone-1/trying_out_Focus_Bear.md/explore-the-app](https://www.figma.com/design/osmtseydPHIBYnxiYAZ67g/milestone-1%2Ftrying_out_Focus_Bear.md%2Fexplore-the-app?node-id=0-1&t=Cv6LEXE2dsJenFZM-1) for reference.

   - I decided to click ‚ÄòSave Goals‚Äô and the button disappear. Then I decided to fill in another new long term goal and click ‚ÄòApply Changes‚Äô
   - None of the long term goals I added in display on the interface.
   - I tried to scroll down and saw them added in the list of goals.
   - At this point, I picked up an understanding that I had to select them after adding them into the goal list. Then click ‚ÄòApply Changes‚Äô to actually add them as my own goals.
   - Now the newly created goals were successfully added into my goal list.

   In my point of UX view, there were too many unnecessary clicks and confusion between what 'Save Goals' and 'Apply Changes' do.

2. Add a quick-start checklist or dashboard for new users to get set up faster.

3. For intern onboard, Lock down the Google Doc install instructions to view-only to avoid accidental edits.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Share your Focus Bear user ID with jeznag in Discord so you can get ongoing access ‚úÖ

Shared it in the onboarding survey.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What was your first impression of the app?

My first impression was that Focus Bear has a clean, minimal design and feels purpose-built for users who want help with focus, routines, and reducing distractions. It felt unique and supportive from the start.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Did you find anything difficult to understand?

Yes. The onboarding could be more guided‚Äîthere was no step-by-step walkthrough for first-time users, so I had to figure things out through trial and error. Also, the instructions in the Google Doc should be view-only for users, not editable by everyone.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

Focus Bear is a productivity app designed to help you stay focused, build healthy routines, and reduce digital distractions‚Äîespecially helpful for people with ADHD or executive function challenges.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

1. There should be some loop clips to onboard users so they can know what to expect for the UI. Look at Tiimo‚Äôs onboarding loop video on there website. Their new users can see the Application interface and some core features without having to sign up or sign in. This is very good user experience or marketing because if they can know what to expect from the product, they tend to be able to evaluate of this product match their needs and start onboarding.
2. Another issue I found is that the window of the app does not go behind another window even though another window is not selected. This is a very inconvenience experience because users have to drag Focus Bear window here and there to see other windows.
3. Also there is not Back button to go to previous page
