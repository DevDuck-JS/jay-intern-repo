# Research Assignment: Competitive Landscape

## Task: Compare Focus Bear with Other Productivity Apps

### 📌 Be completely honest in your evaluation

Focus Bear might not always be better than other tools, and that’s okay! The goal is to understand the competitive landscape and think critically about where Focus Bear stands.

### 📌 Research & Learn

#### 1️⃣ Freedom

Freedom is a website and app blocker that helps users eliminate digital distractions and stay focused. It features a simple user interface with options for scheduling focus sessions and creating distraction-free blocks of time. One of its strengths is its ability to block distracting sites and apps across multiple devices simultaneously. Freedom lets users block the internet entirely to focus deeply on work.

#### 2️⃣ Cold Turkey

Cold Turkey is a powerful and rigid blocker for apps and websites, known for being even harder to bypass than Freedom. It offers “frozen” focus sessions that cannot be canceled once started, providing a strict structure for deep focus. Unlike other productivity tools, Cold Turkey doesn’t include features related to wellness or habit-building. Cold Turkey is ideal for people who want strict digital discipline without flexibility.

#### 3️⃣ Tiimo

Tiimo is a visual daily planner designed with neurodivergent users in mind. It uses icons, timers, and calming visuals to create an intuitive and gentle planning experience. The app focuses heavily on routine-building and executive functioning support, making it easier for users to manage their day in a structured yet flexible way. Tiimo is great for users who need visual structure and gentle task management.

#### 4️⃣ Routinery

Routinery is a routine-building app that applies principles of behavioral psychology to help users develop and stick to healthy habits. It features pre-built routines and uses a timer-based approach to guide users through their daily activities. The app encourages reflection and consistency to support long-term habit formation. Example: Routinery is perfect for those trying to automate daily self-care or productivity habits.

### 📌 Then, reflect on the following questions

#### 1️⃣ What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear combines habit-building, routine tracking, and distraction blocking in one tool while also being built with neurodivergent users in mind. It focuses more on movement breaks, deep focus sessions, and full-day planning, not just app blocking or routines.

#### 2️⃣ If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

I’d choose Focus Bear because it’s an all-in-one tool that supports both my productivity and wellbeing. The blend of habit tracking, movement breaks, and flexible distraction control is ideal for maintaining a sustainable work style.

#### 3️⃣ What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Visual scheduling like in Tiimo, where users see their day as a timeline with icons, would be helpful—especially for visual learners.

#### 4️⃣ Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Focus Bear could add a visual timeline or calendar view to help users plan and visualize their day better—especially useful for neurodivergent users who benefit from visual structure.
