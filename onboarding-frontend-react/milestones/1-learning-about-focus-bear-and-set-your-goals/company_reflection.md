# 1️⃣ Understanding Focus Bear’s Mission & Vision

## Reflections on the given questions

### 1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

After exploring the website, I have come to the conclusion that Focus Bear was created to help people, especially neurodivergent individuals, overcome distractions and build healthy routines so they can be more productive and balanced in their daily lives.

Mjor features offered Focus Bear are tools to support focus, like movement breaks and habit tracking, which are often missing from traditional productivity apps.

### 2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear is trying to solve the problem of poor focus, procrastination, and executive functioning challenges, especially common among people with ADHD and Autism.

Many users struggle with task initiation and maintaining routines, and Focus Bear gives them structure without being overwhelming.

### 3. Why do you think this mission is important?

I think this mission is important because focus and routine are essential for personal growth and mental well-being, yet traditional productivity tools often fail to support people with different cognitive needs.

Without proper support, individuals can feel stuck or burnt out, Focus Bear helps them work in a way that fits their brain.

### 4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear aligns with my values of accessibility, empathy, and intentional productivity. I’m passionate about building inclusive tools that actually make people’s lives better, not just more efficient.

I care about tech that’s human-centered, and Focus Bear's mission to serve neurodivergent users reflects that.

I, myself, am suffering from short focus and might end up using Focus Bear daily when it is optimized into its best version (which I'm planning to contribute to).

### 5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I often struggle with staying focused and maintaining consistency in my routines, whether when working alone or in shared workspace.

Tools like Focus Bear’s distraction blocker and habit nudges help me stay on track and remind me to take breaks, which improves both my productivity and mental health.
