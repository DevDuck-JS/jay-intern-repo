### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Common Cyber Security Threats in a Remote Work Environment

In a remote work environment, specific cyber security threats become more prevalent. Below are some of the most common threats:

##### 1. Phishing & Social Engineering (More Frequent in Remote Work)

Attackers exploit employees working alone without IT supervision.  
Fake emails impersonating company executives or IT support can easily trick remote workers.

##### 2. Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks & Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

Home or public Wi-Fi may lack encryption, making it easier for hackers to intercept data.  
For exmaple, employees using public hotspots without VPNs risk MITM attacks.

##### 3. Use of Personal & Unmanaged Devices (BYOD Risks)

Employees using personal laptops or smartphones may lack security updates or company-approved antivirus software.  
Lost or stolen devices pose a data security risk if not encrypted.

##### 4. Shadow IT (Unauthorized Applications & Cloud Storage)

Employees may use unapproved apps for file sharing or communication (e.g., personal Google Drive, Dropbox, Telegram).  
Lack of security oversight can lead to **data leaks**.

##### 5. Weak or Reused Passwords (Higher Risk Without IT Supervision)

Remote employees might not follow strong password policies.  
Without company-enforced password managers, users may **reuse credentials** across multiple platforms.

##### 6. Outdated Software & Unpatched Systems

Personal devices might not receive security patches regularly.  
Employees ignoring updates can leave security gaps.

##### 7. VPN & Cloud Security Misconfigurations

VPNs or cloud services may be misconfigured, exposing company data.  
Weak API security can lead to unauthorized access.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Remote Work Security

Given the common threats in remote working environment from the previous question, here are the best practices to stay safe:

‚úîÔ∏è **Use a VPN** when accessing company resources.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all accounts.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Update software & security patches** regularly.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Use company-approved password managers** to generate & store strong passwords.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Avoid using public Wi-Fi** or use a VPN if necessary.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Verify email sources** before clicking on links or attachments.

Implementing these best practices allow organizations to significantly reduce cyber security risks in remote work environments.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

If you leave your computer unlocked, anyone can open it, see your data, access your accounts to applications, and even pretend to be you. Locking your computer when away from your desk prevents unauthorized access, protects sensitive data, and reduces security risks like data breaches or misuse. It ensures that confidential information remains secure, especially in shared or public spaces.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

Verify the sender, look for red flags like urgent requests or strange email addresses, and report phishing attempts to your IT team. When in doubt, go directly to the official website instead of clicking links. Never click on suspicious links or open unexpected attachments.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

A strong password is long (12+ characters), unique, and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Using a password manager, like 1Password, (not sponsored) helps store and generate secure passwords, preventing reuse and making it easier to manage multiple accounts safely.

An example of a strong password is: `Gv!9pXz#2mTq@7Lf`

It‚Äôs long (16+ characters), random, and includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

For better security, use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords instead of creating them yourself.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step (like a code from your phone or email) along with your password. This prevents hackers from accessing your accounts even if they steal your password.

Example: If someone gets your banking password, they still can't log in without the 2FA code sent to your phone or email.

Apart from phone SMS OTP and email OTP, security code authenticators like Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) that refresh every few seconds, adding an extra layer of security beyond passwords.

YubiKey, on the other hand, is a hardware security key that provides even stronger protection by requiring physical access to authenticate logins.

These tools help prevent unauthorized access, even if someone steals your password. Use them for important accounts like emails, banking, and work apps.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

I currently follow several security best practices, such as using strong passwords, storing my password in a password manager app, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on important accounts, and avoiding suspicious links. I also avoid using public Wi-Fi or use a VPN when accessing sensitive information on public Wi-Fi.

However, I can improve by ensuring all my devices are regularly updated with security patches, changing my password every specific period of time, and being more vigilant about **phishing attempts** by verifying email sources before clicking on links. Additionally, I should minimize the use of personal devices for work-related tasks to reduce security risks.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

Using these strategies helps me stay safe from potential security risks:

- Enable automatic software updates to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Use a password manager to create and store complex passwords effortlessly.
- Always lock my computer whenever I step away, even for a short time.
- Stay cautious of emails and messages requesting sensitive information.
- Regularly review and update security settings on my accounts.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

- Long, complex, and unique passwords for each account.
- Enable 2FA on all important accounts, including emails, banking, and work platforms.
- Use a password manager to avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites.
- Regularly update passwords and remove access to old or unused accounts.

Additionally, I will enable security code authenticators like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator where possible and consider a hardware security key like YubiKey for added protection.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If I suspect a security breach, I will:

1. Immediately change my password to a strong, unique one.
2. Check for unauthorized logins or activities in my account settings.
3. Enable or review 2FA settings to ensure no one else has access.
4. Report the issue to the IT/security team (if work-related) or the service provider.
5. Scan my device for malware to rule out keyloggers or other threats.

By acting quickly, I can minimize potential damage and secure my accounts effectively.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.

I have been using 2FA with every accounts on every applications and devices.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review your password storage method‚Äîif you‚Äôre not using a password manager, consider setting one up.

I already use it.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes

I have a habit of locking my computer every time I'm away even for 5 minutes.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.

I have been familiar to security strategies. However, there is always a room to enhance my security practice when entering into a new environment.

A new cybersecurity habit I will follow at Focus Bear is verifying all software and tools before installation.

I will ensure that any new applications, browser extensions, or cloud services I use for work are approved by the company and do not introduce security risks. This will help prevent Shadow IT, unauthorized data storage, and potential malware threats.

Before using any third-party tools, I will:

- Check if it is company-approved or request IT approval.
- Verify the software source to avoid downloading from untrusted sites.
- Review permissions to ensure it does not request excessive access.

Following this habit helps maintain a secure digital workspace at Focus Bear and reduce the risk of data leaks or security vulnerabilities.
