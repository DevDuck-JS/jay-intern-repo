# üèÜ Milestone: Company Policies

## üîí Cyber Security

### üéØ Goal

Understand how to keep company and user data secure by following cyber security best practices.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

Cyber security breaches can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage. Everyone at Focus Bear plays a role in keeping information safe by following good security habits.

#### Common Cyber Security Threats in a Remote Work Environment

In a remote work environment, specific cyber security threats become more prevalent. Below are some of the most common threats:

##### 1. Phishing & Social Engineering (More Frequent in Remote Work)

Attackers exploit employees working alone without IT supervision.  
Fake emails impersonating company executives or IT support can easily trick remote workers.

##### 2. Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks & Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

Home or public Wi-Fi may lack encryption, making it easier for hackers to intercept data.  
For exmaple, employees using public hotspots without VPNs risk MITM attacks.

##### 3. Use of Personal & Unmanaged Devices (BYOD Risks)

Employees using personal laptops or smartphones may lack security updates or company-approved antivirus software.  
Lost or stolen devices pose a data security risk if not encrypted.

##### 4. Shadow IT (Unauthorized Applications & Cloud Storage)

Employees may use unapproved apps for file sharing or communication (e.g., personal Google Drive, Dropbox, Telegram).  
Lack of security oversight can lead to **data leaks**.

##### 5. Weak or Reused Passwords (Higher Risk Without IT Supervision)

Remote employees might not follow strong password policies.  
Without company-enforced password managers, users may **reuse credentials** across multiple platforms.

##### 6. Outdated Software & Unpatched Systems

Personal devices might not receive security patches regularly.  
Employees ignoring updates can leave security gaps.

##### 7. VPN & Cloud Security Misconfigurations

VPNs or cloud services may be misconfigured, exposing company data.  
Weak API security can lead to unauthorized access.

#### üîê Best Practices for Remote Work Security

Given the common threats in remote working environment from the previous question, here are the best practices to stay safe:

‚úîÔ∏è **Use a VPN** when accessing company resources.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all accounts.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Update software & security patches** regularly.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Use company-approved password managers** to generate & store strong passwords.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Avoid using public Wi-Fi** or use a VPN if necessary.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Verify email sources** before clicking on links or attachments.

Implementing these best practices allow organizations to significantly reduce cyber security risks in remote work environments.
