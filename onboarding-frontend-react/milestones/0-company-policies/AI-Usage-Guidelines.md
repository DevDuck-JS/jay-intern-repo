# üèÜ Milestone: Company Policies

## ü§ñ Use of AI Tools

### üéØ Goal

Understand how to responsibly and effectively use AI tools while maintaining data privacy and critical thinking.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

AI tools can boost productivity, but they should be used thoughtfully. Misuse‚Äîsuch as leaking confidential information or relying on AI without critical thinking‚Äîcan cause serious problems.

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What AI tools are typically used for your role?

I use ChatGPT to learn new concepts, answers my questions. Perplexity and NotebookLM are also great tools to quickly read from academic books or articles. Grammarly is a beneficial AI tool for writing.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?

**Benefits:**

- Increases efficiency and automates repetitive tasks.
- Improves decision-making by analyzing large data sets.
- Enhances creativity by generating ideas and content.

**Risks:**

- May produce inaccurate or biased outputs.
- Could expose confidential data if used improperly.
- Reduces critical thinking if relied on too heavily.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?

- Confidential company data (e.g., financial reports, internal strategies).
- Personal information (e.g., passwords, employee details).
- Sensitive customer data (e.g., addresses, credit card info).

I, personally, also do not post pictures of my face, personal belongings, and assets.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?

- Cross-check information with reliable sources (e.g., official websites, research papers).
- Verify numbers & data against trusted reports.
- Use human judgment to assess bias or inconsistencies.
- Ask AI for sources and double-check credibility.

My personal example is when I ask an AI to generate statistics for a market report, I will verify them with industry publications before including them.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

I should use AI for efficiency and automation, such as drafting content, generating ideas, summarizing information, or automating repetitive tasks. AI is also helpful for coding assistance, grammar checks, and brainstorming solutions.

However, I should rely on my own skills for critical decision-making, problem-solving, and tasks requiring human judgment, such as analyzing business strategies, handling confidential data, or verifying AI-generated outputs.

For example, I can use AI to generate a draft email, but I will review and personalize it before sending.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

- Use AI as a tool, not a replacement ‚Äì Treat AI as an assistant, not the final decision-maker.
- Verify AI outputs ‚Äì Always fact-check and refine information before using it.
- Continue developing my own skills ‚Äì Stay sharp in critical thinking, creativity, and problem-
- Set limits on AI usage ‚Äì Only use it when necessary, not for tasks I can easily do myself.

For example, instead of relying on AI for every code snippet, I will first try to solve the problem myself and use AI only when needed.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

- Never input confidential, personal, or sensitive data into AI tools.
- Use company-approved AI platforms that follow security policies.
- Review AI privacy policies to understand data handling practices.
- Anonymize data when possible before processing it through AI tools.

For exmaple, if I need AI to analyze trends, I will use generalized data instead of inputting real customer details.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.

I can improve writing technical documentation using AI tools like ChatGPT or Notion AI. These tools can help generate structured content, summarize complex concepts, and improve clarity.

An example scenarios is when I used ChatGPT to create an initial draft of a project README file, which saved time compared to writing it from scratch.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review the AI-generated output critically‚Äîdid it require editing or fact-checking?

Yes, the AI-generated README file provided a good structure but required editing for accuracy, clarity, and formatting. I had to:

- Refine technical explanations to ensure correctness.
- Reformat sections for readability.
- Verify terminology to match company standards.

An example scenarios is when the AI suggested a vague project description, so I rewrote it to be more specific and relevant to the actual project.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.

One best practice I will follow is to always review, edit, and fact-check AI-generated content before using it.

While AI tools can improve efficiency, I will never accept outputs at face value. Instead, I will:

1. Verify accuracy by cross-checking with reliable sources.
2. Refine AI-generated content to match company tone and style.
3. Ensure no confidential or sensitive data is entered into AI tools.
