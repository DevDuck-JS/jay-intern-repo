#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What types of data are considered confidential at Focus Bear?

- Personal user data: Names, contact information, and payment details.
- Technical data: IP addresses, device information, and login details.
- Financial data: Billing records, transaction history, and payment methods.
- Internal business data: Product development plans, internal discussions, and proprietary algorithms.
- Customer feedback & survey data: User insights, behavior tracking, and usage analytics.

For example, a user's payment details stored for subscription billing are considered confidential data and must be protected from unauthorized access.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are best practices for handling confidential data?

- Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP) ‚Äì Only access data necessary for your role.
- Use secure storage & encryption ‚Äì Keep sensitive information encrypted and protected.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) ‚Äì Add an extra layer of security for login credentials.
- Avoid sharing sensitive data via unsecured channels ‚Äì No confidential data should be sent over public chat apps or email.
- Regularly update software & security patches ‚Äì Prevent vulnerabilities in the system.
- Be mindful of phishing attacks & social engineering ‚Äì Always verify sources before clicking links or sharing data.

For exmaple, instead of sharing a user‚Äôs financial details via email, use a secure internal system to process transactions.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information?

- Report the incident immediately ‚Äì Notify the Data Protection Officer (DPO) or IT security team.
- Contain the breach ‚Äì Restrict access to the compromised data to prevent further exposure.
- Assess the impact ‚Äì Determine what data was affected and potential risks.
- Notify affected parties if required ‚Äì In compliance with GDPR, users must be informed of serious breaches.
- Take preventive actions ‚Äì Implement new security measures to prevent future incidents.

For exmaple, if an employee accidentally shares user data with an unauthorized recipient, they must report it immediately so corrective actions can be taken.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

1. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Only access the data necessary for my role.
2. Use strong passwords and enable MFA: Prevent unauthorized access.
3. Encrypt sensitive files: Ensure that confidential data is protected.
4. Be cautious with email and messaging apps: Avoid sharing sensitive data via unsecured channels.
5. Log out of accounts when not in use: Prevent unauthorized access to company systems.

For exmaple, instead of storing confidential user data in a personal document, I will use an encrypted company-approved database.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

- Store: Use encrypted storage solutions and secure servers instead of local files.
- Share: Only share data over secure, company-approved channels with authorized individuals.
- Dispose: Follow data retention policies and use secure deletion methods for digital files and shredding for physical documents.

For example, if I need to share internal reports, I will use a password-protected document rather than sending raw data over email.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

- Weak passwords & lack of MFA ‚Üí Solution: Use a password manager and enable multi-factor authentication.
- Leaving devices unattended/unlocked ‚Üí Solution: Always lock devices when stepping away.
- Sharing data through unsecured channels ‚Üí Solution: Only use encrypted communication tools.
- Falling for phishing attacks ‚Üí Solution: Always verify email sources and avoid clicking suspicious links.

For example, to avoid phishing scams, I will double-check email addresses before opening links or attachments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.

1. I will make it a habit to log out of systems and lock my computer whenever I step away from my desk, even if it's just for a few minutes. Why? This ensures that unauthorized individuals cannot access sensitive information left open on my screen.

2. Setup 2FA or maxmimum layer of security as it is the safest way to keep the data secured despite the trade off with authentication process.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.

My key learning here is that data security is a shared responsibility‚Äîsmall habits like using strong passwords, verifying email sources, and encrypting sensitive files can prevent major security risks.

Security Measure that I will implement is to use encrypted storage and secure file-sharing tools instead of personal cloud storage to protect company data from leaks or unauthorized access.
