# üèÜ Milestone: Company Policies

## üè¢ Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

### üéØ Goal

Understand how to set up a safe and ergonomic workspace, especially when using a laptop, and develop habits to prevent strain and discomfort.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

Many people work directly on their laptops without an external monitor or keyboard, leading to poor posture, neck strain, and wrist discomfort. Making simple adjustments can prevent long-term injuries and improve focus.

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?

I found that poor working station setup gave me the following pains:

- Poor posture: Looking down at a laptop screen causes neck and back strain.
- Wrist discomfort: Typing on a built-in keyboard without wrist support can lead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI).
- Eye strain: Small screens and improper angles increase the risk of digital eye fatigue.

Using a laptop directly on a desk forces users to hunch over, leading to "tech neck" and upper back pain over time.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)

Here are the items that I invest for my work-from-home station:

- Laptop stand raises the screen to eye level, reducing neck strain.
- Sit-stand desk allows me to change my posture and relieve the muscle while continuing to focus on my work
- External keyboard & mouse keeps wrists in a neutral position.
- Ergonomic chair provides lumbar support and encourages good posture.
- Footrest helps maintain a comfortable seated position, especially for shorter individuals.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?

- Monitor height: The top of the screen should be at eye level to avoid neck strain.
- Chair position: Feet should be flat on the floor, and knees at a 90-degree angle.
- Desk setup: Wrists should remain straight while typing, and elbows should be at a 90-degree angle for comfort.

Adjusting the monitor height with a stand and ensuring the chair supports the lower back helps maintain a neutral spine posture.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)

- Take movement breaks: stand up and stretch or push up every 30-60 minutes.
- Practice the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.
- Check posture regularly: Sit upright, shoulders relaxed, and avoid slouching.
- Use wrist stretches & hand exercises: Prevents strain from repetitive typing.

Setting a reminder to stretch every hour and following the 20-20-20 rule reduces discomfort from screen time.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

I place my laptop on a stand and use an external keyboard and mouse to prevent hunching over. I also use an external monitor to keep the screen at eye level and reduce neck strain.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

I will set a Focus Bear reminder every hour to ...

1. stand up and stretch for a few minutes
2. sit upright with shoulders relaxed and lower back supported
3. take movement breaks every 30-60 minutes to stretch and reset posture
4. follow the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain from prolonged screen use

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

Apart from using my smartwatch or phone alarm, I will activate Focus Bear‚Äôs movement reminders and set an hourly alarm to ensure I take breaks to consistently stand, stretch, or adjust my posture.
I can also place a sticky note on my screen with a reminder to check my posture.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices. ‚úÖ

I have a sit-stand desk, a memory-foam ergonomic chair, 2 external monitors, a laptop stand, a footrest. Everything is adjusted due to my physique (I really would like to share my workstation setup - big investment). üëç

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.

As I mentioned, I have a few ergonomic items that help maintain my posture and focues. Descpite perfection coming from everything combined, I'd like to raise that my best investment is the ergonomic chair.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)

After a day of following posture reminders, I felt less fatigue and more focused during work.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

I added a routine of taking a break to stretch or push-up during the from time to time.
