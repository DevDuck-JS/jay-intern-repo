# 🏆 Milestone: Company Policies

## 🤝 Professionalism at Focus Bear

### 🎯 Goal

Understand professional expectations at Focus Bear and how to communicate effectively while maintaining a positive and inclusive work environment.

### ❓ Why is this important?

At Focus Bear, professionalism doesn’t mean wearing a suit—we believe in a relaxed, fun, and supportive work culture. You’re allowed to laugh, have fun, and be yourself while still being respectful and accountable in your work.

A professional environment means:
✅ Being kind and respectful to teammates
✅ Communicating clearly and professionally
✅ Avoiding discrimination, bullying, and toxic behaviour
✅ Handling feedback constructively

### 🔍 Research & Learn

#### 1️⃣ What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)

Here are some criteria that point out professional and unprofessional behaviors in the work environment:
**Professional Behaviour:**

- Being respectful and supportive in team interactions.
- Active listening in meetings without interrupting others.
- Clear and concise communication in messages and emails.
- Meeting deadlines and taking accountability for tasks.

**Unprofessional Behaviour:**

- Ignoring messages or providing unclear, rude, or dismissive responses.
- Speaking over others in meetings or not listening to teammates.
- Making inappropriate jokes or excluding team members.
- Missing deadlines without notifying the team.

Example between the two behaviors:
✅ Professional: “Hey team, I’m running behind on this task but will have an update by tomorrow.”
❌ Unprofessional: Ignoring the delay and letting teammates wonder what’s happening.

#### 2️⃣ What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)

A good example of a respectful communication would be:
✅ “I see your point, but I think we might get better results by trying XYZ. What do you think?”
A bad example would be:
❌ “That idea won’t work at all.”

Here are why the first statement make a respectful communication:

- Use a friendly and professional tone – Avoid messages that seem too abrupt.
- Acknowledge messages and give updates – Don’t leave teammates hanging.
- Disagree respectfully – Express concerns without attacking others.
- Use inclusive language – Be mindful of cultural and language differences.

#### 3️⃣ How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)

Do:
✅ “I noticed the report was missing some key data. Could we double-check the sources next time?”
Don't:
❌ “You always mess up the reports.”

The first statement makes professional feedback giving because it ...

- focuses on actions, not personality – Constructive feedback should be about work, not the person.
- assumes good intent – Approach feedback as a way to improve, not criticize.
- asks for clarification instead of reacting defensively.

#### 4️⃣ What are Focus Bear’s expectations for inclusivity and respect? (Hint: Avoiding discrimination, supporting teammates, and being mindful of different communication styles.)

Focus Bear’s expectations for inclusivity and respect are:

- Avoid discrimination and stereotypes – Treat everyone equally.
- Support teammates – Encourage collaboration and help when needed.
- Be mindful of communication styles – Some teammates prefer direct messages, while others need context.

A good exmaple scenario is when a teammate struggles in a meeting, offer support instead of ignoring the issue.

### 📝 Reflection

#### 1️⃣ Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes! Effective teamwork happens when everyone communicates clearly, respects each other’s input, and supports one another.

In a past project, my team had weekly check-ins where everyone provided updates and helped each other troubleshoot problems. This open communication prevented misunderstandings and improved collaboration.

#### 2️⃣ What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

In a scenario which conflicts arise, instead of saying, “You’re wrong,” I can say, “I see it differently—here’s why.”

Do:

- Use a positive and professional tone in messages.
- Acknowledge and clarify instead of making assumptions.
- Be mindful of how cultural differences impact communication styles.

#### 3️⃣ How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

Assuming that a teammate achieves a milestone, giving them a shout-out in a team chat can boost morale.

Here are the big benefit from doing these little things:

- Encourage open communication and teamwork.
- Celebrate small wins and recognize teammates’ contributions.
- Maintain a balance between casual and professional interactions.

### 🛠️ Task

#### 1️⃣ Take note of the CEO's phone number (shared in the onboarding deck) - make contact if you see major breaches of professional conduct or other issues ✅

Action Taken: I have saved the Jeremy's contact information for reporting serious professionalism concerns if needed.
