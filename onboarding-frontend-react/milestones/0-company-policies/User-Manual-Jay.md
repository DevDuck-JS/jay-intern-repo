## üìñ Creating Your "User Manual for Me"

### üéØ Goal

Create a personal "User Manual" to help teammates understand how to work with you effectively.

### ‚ùì Why is this important?

Everyone has different working styles, preferences, and communication needs. Writing a simple guide about yourself makes collaboration smoother and more enjoyable.

### üîç Research & Learn

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a ‚ÄúUser Manual for Me‚Äù, and why do teams use them?

A "User Manual for Me" is a personal guide that outlines how an individual works best, their communication preferences, and how teammates can collaborate with them effectively.

In my opinion to 'Why we use them', my user manual can benefit my teammates with the following points:

- Helps teammates understand each other‚Äôs working styles.
- Reduces friction and miscommunication.
- Improves collaboration by setting clear expectations.

For example, I may say in my user manual that "I prefer written communication over calls and like to receive feedback with specific examples.". This will help my teammate prepare to reach me and get the most effective result out of the communication.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)

A good personal user manual can typically includes:

- Communication Style ‚Äì Do you prefer Slack messages, emails, or calls?
- Work Habits ‚Äì When are you most productive? Do you prefer deep work blocks?
- Feedback Preferences ‚Äì Do you like direct feedback, or do you prefer a softer approach?
- Collaboration Style ‚Äì Do you enjoy brainstorming together or working independently first?
- Things That Help Me Work Best ‚Äì Do you need clear instructions, or do you like autonomy?

For example, I can say "I work best with clear goals and autonomy but appreciate check-ins for alignment."

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?

Writing a personal user manual can help team achieve effectively by

- Setting clear expectations, so teammates know how to approach each other
- Helping avoid miscommunication, especially in remote teams
- Allowing for better collaboration by aligning work styles
- Reduceing frustration by clarifying preferences upfront

Examplel: If a teammate knows I prefer detailed written instructions, they won‚Äôt assume a quick verbal update is enough, leading to better collaboration.

### üìù Reflection

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)

I need written documentation like minute of meeting (MoM) to be completed every time we discussed over something even the smallest issues. This will benefit everyone as a reference to say aligned in the future and save so much time from misunderstanding and miscommunication.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)

I prefer written commincation like discord and email. For visualization alignment, I prefer video call and screensharing especially when working on front-end projects where we need to see the designs and interactive prototypes. I would be so happy if then we can have note summary after the discussion over the video call.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)

The more quiet, the more productive I become. Therefore, I prefer working from home where I have my invested working station. I also need to-do list to help me focus and quickly have a visual of what I'm currently working on. Music is beneficial to drowse distractions from the surroundings in case that I'm working in a public space.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)

I do not do drama or take things personally. Feel free to give me direct feedback. The more on-point and equipped with example, the more time we both save. I'm happy with all verbal, visual, or written as long as you make it clear and ready to respond if I ask for clarification (so I can serve what you need).

My tips when I give feedback to my colleague is I praise them in public but I make sure to give contructive comments in private to save their faces, our relationships, and the overall working environment.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)

I love visualizing ideas. I have chalk pens in multiple colors to draws diagrams on my windows and walls üòÜ. I also love brainstorming with my teammates as they always raise ideas that I don't think about. Then I write things down to summary and note my progress just so I (and other people) can catch up with the update later on and continue working from that point in a fast pace, saving so much time wondering where-we-were-yesterday sort of thing.

### üõ†Ô∏è Task

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write your User Manual for Me using the structure below.

## üìñ User Manual for Jay

### My role

I'm working learn React.js, Redux, and Next.js to contribute the most while I'm taking my Front-end developer role.

### How I Work Best

I work best in my own quiet environment from home.
I struggle working in the public area or having people asking me questions interrupting me from my flow state. I'm sure if you have ADHD, you'll understand the pain.

### Communication Style

Discords, emails, video calls with sharescreen, mobile for urgent issue -> must have written documentations after discussion. My brain's storage space is small and almost full.

### Collaboration & Teamwork

I need meeting agenda BEFORE meeting session. I require the meeting agenda AND meeting note displayed while discussing over the topic just to make sure that we all have the same focus - no one drag the team out of the topic. Nobody is confused about what we're doing.

I would appreciate if each person WAITS and TAKES turn to talk instead of interrupting someone else. This PROFESSIONAL gesture would keep the conversation flow and accomplish in the fastest time.

### Focus & Productivity

I stay focused working from home as there is no interruptions or disctractions.
Things that distracts me are people coming to ask questions while I'm in my flow state.
The best way to support my productivity is leave the message if it's not urgent. I check the message from time to time and I'll reply as soon as I read it.

### Feedback & Growth

I like feedback to be...

- Direct and to the point.
- Equipped with examples to make it clear and actionable.
- Given in any format (verbal, visual, or written) as long as it‚Äôs clear and open to clarification.

When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is...

- Give me direct feedback without sugarcoating.
- Be clear and specific so we can save time.
- Be ready to clarify if I need more details.

I appreciate it when teammates...

- Give honest and constructive feedback that helps me improve.
- Praise others publicly, but keep constructive criticism private to maintain relationships and a positive work environment.
- Communicate clearly and openly, so we can collaborate effectively.

### FunFacts & Quirk

- One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I'm a stressful perfectionist instead of being just a serious nerd (& having fun overcoming new challenges).
- A fun fact about me is my windows and walls are full of chalk drawings.
- My work superpower is I always seek to delivery beyond what I promise.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Share it with your manager or teammates so they can better understand how to work with you. ‚úÖ
